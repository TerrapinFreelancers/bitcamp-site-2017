          <h3 class="heading"> What's Bitcamp? </h3>
          <p>
            Bitcamp is a place for exploration. We're a hackathon that values
            participant experience and mentorship over competitiveness and points.
            Come to have fun with your friends, learn something new, eat s'mores
            , and have a generally awesome time. We have all sorts of crazy
            activities planned for you...you'll have to come to find out the rest!</p>
          <h3 class="heading"> What's a hackathon? </h3>
          <p>
            A hackathon is a creative coding marathon. Students are encouraged
            to come with an idea, form teams, and then build out that
            idea into a product in 36 hours. For Bitcamp, we want you to take
            something you love (sports! art! camping!) and combine it with technology
            to make something awesome. It is a great time to push the envelope and
            learn some new skills.
          </p>
